# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Lab

Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cleaned dataset. The goal is to uncover insights from the data by analyzing its distribution, identifying outliers, and exploring correlations between features.

Objectives

In this lab, the following tasks were accomplished:

Distribution Analysis:

Investigated how data is distributed across various features.

Outlier Detection and Removal:

Identified anomalies in the data that could distort analysis results.

Removed outliers to enhance data quality.

Feature Correlation Analysis:

Explored relationships between different features using correlation metrics.

Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.

matplotlib: For plotting and data visualization.

numpy: For numerical computations.

Methodology

Data Loading:

The dataset was loaded using pandas.read_csv().

Special handling was implemented to accommodate JupyterLite environments.

Data Exploration:

Summary statistics and data types were reviewed.

Missing values were identified and managed appropriately.

Visualization:

Used histograms and boxplots to examine data distribution.

Scatter plots and heatmaps were employed to understand feature correlations.

Outlier Treatment:

Outliers were detected using statistical methods.

Adjustments were made to improve dataset reliability.

Key Findings

Data Distribution:

The majority of features showed normal or skewed distributions.

Outliers:

Significant outliers were identified and removed from critical features.

Correlations:

Strong correlations between certain features were observed, providing insights into underlying relationships.

How to Use

To replicate or extend this analysis:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of EDA in understanding datasets and preparing them for further analysis. The techniques and insights gained from this analysis can serve as a foundation for predictive modeling or other advanced analytics.
